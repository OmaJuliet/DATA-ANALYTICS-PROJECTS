# GLOBAL SALARY DATA ANALYSIS

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Analysis carried using data source from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zedataweaver/global-salary-data) for reference.

## Questions to be answered from the analysis and visualization
1. What are the top countries with the highest and lowest average salary earned by individuals according to the data set?
2. What is highest to lowest average salary earned by individuals per continent?
3. What are the countries with the highest and lowest salary earned in each continent?


## STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION
Data was collected from Kaggle website at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)

## STEP 2: DATA VALIDATION AND EXPLORATION USING JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
- Renamed some column names
- Checked for missing values
- Checked for how many elements the data has
- Validated unique continents and countries
- Checked for total number of continents and countries
- Checked for top 10 countries with highest average salary
- Checked for top 5 countries with the highest salary earned monthly
- Checked for top 5 countries with the lowest salary earned monthly


## STEP 3: DATA ANALYSIS
- Descriptive Analysis to summarize the statistics
- Comparative analysis to compare salaries across continents
- Prescriptive analysis to identify countries with highest and lowest average salaries
- Saved cleaned DataFrame as an Excel file


## STEP 4: DATA MODELLING USING DAX 
- Created measures to get total number of countries
- Created measures to get total number of continents
- Created measures, calculated columns, and filter to get the countries with the highest salary for each continent
- Created measures, calculated columns, and filter to get the countries with the lowest salary for each continent


## STEP 5: DATA VISUALIZATION USING POWER BI
- Imported cleaned data into Power BI
- Used visuals to answer the above questions
- - Total Confirmed Cases and Deaths: Create a card visualization showing the total confirmed cases and deaths.
- - Top Countries by Cases and Deaths: Create bar charts or tables showing the top 10 countries by confirmed cases and deaths.
- - Spread Rate Across Continents: Create a line chart or area chart showing the rate of spread across different continents.
