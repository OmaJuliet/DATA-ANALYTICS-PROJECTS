# HR Analytics Dashboard Project
In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyze HR data and create an interactive dashboard with intuitive page navigation. The key insights I derived using custom measures and data transformations include:

1. Promotion Analysis: Identified employees due for promotion, not due for promotion, and calculated their respective percentages.

2. Gender Distribution: Visualized the total number of male and female employees and their percentages.

3. Workforce Status: Distinguished active employees from those due for retrenchment and calculated their proportions.

4. Job Levels: Provided a breakdown of employees by job levels.

5. Employee Distance: Categorized employee distances using a conditional column during data transformation.

6. Departmental Analysis: Analyzed employees due for promotion or retrenchment by department.

7. Job Satisfaction: Displayed employees categorized by job satisfaction levels (high, medium, low).

8. Employee Ratings: Highlighted high- and low-rated employees.

This project emphasizes how to utilize Power BIâ€™s interactive features and advanced data modeling to derive actionable HR insights and visualiza them.
